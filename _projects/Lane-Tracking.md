## Abstract

Autonomous cars have attracted much attention because of the potential to reduce car accidents and increase traffic flows.
For such powerful vehicles, a lane tracking system is indispensable to detect routes and decide the directions.
We use traditional algorithm include sobel filter and hough transform to realize a lane tracking system.
The algroithm are implemented as hardware in FPGA.
With the integration of motors, camera and VGA, the system supports real-time lane tracking, motor control and display the result on the monitors.
