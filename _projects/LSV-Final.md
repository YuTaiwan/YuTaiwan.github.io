## Abstract
Boolean relations are more flexible in representation than boolean functions because of its non-determinism. 
However, circuits are must be implemented by deterministic behaviors. 
Therefore, when creating circuits from boolean relations, the problem of determinizing boolean relations arises. Range-preserving determinization, which introduce additional variables to determinize relations while preserving all relation between orignal variables, is one way of such determinization.
In this work we propose three methods to achieve range-preserving determinization, including Maximum Clique, MaxSAT and a unate-splitting methods.
Experimental results show that the unate-splitting method are most efficient among the proposed methods.
