Research experience
======
*Undergraduate Research Assistant*, EDA LAB, NTU, 2017-2019
* Project: Optical Network-on-Chip (ONoCs) Design Automation. 
    * Proposed and implemented an <u> automated structural and physical co-design engine</u> for Optical Network-on-Chip System.
    * Outperformed the state-of-the-art ONoCs work by 40% reduction in maximum insertion loss.
    * Submitted to **Design Automation Conference 2020**

* Project: Optical Interconnect Routing
    * Proposed and implemented a <u>WDM-aware clustering algorithm</u> to minimize both insertion loss and wire length.
    * Outperformed the state-of-the-art algorithm by 60% insertion loss reduction and 45% wire length reduction.
    * Submitted to **Design Automation Conference 2020**

*Undergraduate Research Assistant*, DCS LAB, NTU, 2017-2019
* Project: Encryption IC design
    * Designed an <u>accelerator for the end-to-end encryption Signal Protocol</u>.
    * Designed hardware architecture for cryptographics primitives including SHA-256, Elliptic Curve 25519, AES-256
  
*Undergraduate Research Assistant*, Iris LAB, NTU, 2017-2019
* Project: Timing-Aware Fill Insertion
    * Designed and Implemented an <u>equivalent capacitance guided dummy fill insertion engine</u> for 2018 ICCAD contest.
    * Outperformed all contest winners and the state-of-the-art work by over 27%.
    * Published in **Asia and South Pacific Design Automation Conference 2020** and the paper was **nominated as best paper**.
